// Background submap quad I/O prefetcher.
//
// Worker thread does ONLY disk read + zzip decompression, producing the raw
// JSON bytes of an OMT quad ".map" file. It never touches any game global:
// all paths/flags are resolved on the main thread and captured in the request.
// The main thread later parses+deserializes those bytes (see
// mapbuffer::unserialize_submaps), the only thread-safe place to build submaps.
//
// Reads are served nearest-the-player first (priority), and buffered results are
// bounded by physical locality (evict_beyond) rather than a fixed count, so a
// large prefetch distance no longer drowns the surface quads we cross next.
